Datalakes Parse Parameters 
The table below maps the physical parameter to its given axis. 
 
Axis | Parameter | NetCDF Parameter Name | Unit | Description 
x | Time | time | seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 | Time 
y | Air Temperature | AirTC | Â°C | Air temperature 
y1 | Relative Humidity | RH | % | Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature. Relative humidity depends on temperature and the pressure of the system of interest. The same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than warm air. A related parameter is the dew point. 
y2 | Solar Irradiance | Slrw | W m-2 | The quantity with standard name solar_irradiance, often called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), is the radiation from the sun integrated over the whole electromagnetic spectrum and over the entire solar disk. The quantity applies outside the atmosphere, by default at a distance of one astronomical unit from the sun, but a coordinate or scalar coordinate variable of distance_from_sun can be used to specify a value other than the default. "Irradiance" means the power per unit area (called radiative flux in other standard names), the area being normal to the direction of flow of the radiant energy. 
y3 | Wind Speed | WS | m s-1 | Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) The wind speed is the magnitude of the wind velocity. 
y4 | Wind Direction | WindDir | deg | Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) In meteorological reports, the direction of the wind vector is usually (but not always) given as the direction from which it is blowing (wind_from_direction) (westerly, northerly, etc.). In other contexts, such as atmospheric modelling, it is often natural to give the direction in the usual manner of vectors as the heading or the direction to which it is blowing (wind_to_direction) (eastward, southward, etc.) "from_direction" is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. 
y5 | Rainfall | Rain | mm | "Amount" means mass per unit area. The construction thickness_of_[X_]rainfall_amount means the accumulated "depth" of rainfall i.e. the thickness of a layer of liquid water having the same mass per unit area as the rainfall amount. 
y6 | Air Pressure | BP | mbar | Air pressure is the force per unit area which would be exerted when the moving gas molecules of which the air is composed strike a theoretical surface of any orientation. 
y7 | Binary Error Mask | time_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y8 | Binary Error Mask | Batt_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y9 | Binary Error Mask | Ptemp_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y10 | Binary Error Mask | AirTC_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y11 | Binary Error Mask | RH_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y12 | Binary Error Mask | Slrw_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y13 | Binary Error Mask | Slrm_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y14 | Binary Error Mask | WS_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y15 | Binary Error Mask | WindDir_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y16 | Binary Error Mask | Rain_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
y17 | Binary Error Mask | BP_qual | 0 = nothing to report, 1 = more investigation | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.
